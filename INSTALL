Installation from (release) source tarball
------------------------------------------

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
See also "Installation from development code" further below.

    --enable-tests          Enable tests (e.g. "make check", req. Perl)
    --enable-verbose-tests  Verbose tests

    --enable-nsfw           Install (&test) webscripts marked as "NSFW" [#1]
    --enable-todo           Install (&test) webscripts marked as "TODO" [#2]
    --enable-nlfy           Enable tests for webscripts marked as "NLFY" [#3]

    --disable-quvi          Do not build (&install) the quvi command
    --disable-examples      Do not build examples

    --with-soup             Build with libsoup(-gnome) [#4]
    --without-man           Do not install manual page(s)

[1] Webscripts marked as "NSFW" ("Not Safe For Work")
    (installed only with --enable-nsfw)

[2] Broken and outdated webscripts marked as "TODO" for developers
    (installed only with --enable-todo)

[3] Webscripts marked as "NLFY" ("No Love For You") for websites
    that follow strict country policies, a.k.a.
        "Sorry we do not accept connections from your country"
    (installed always)

[4] Required currently by examples/callback_libsoup.c *only*
    (compiled only with --enable-examples and --with-soup)


Installation from development code
----------------------------------

If you are compiling quvi from the development code, run "autogen.sh".
This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake
  * gengetopt

Once the files have been generated, you can follow the instructions in
"Installation from source tarball".


C API documentation
-------------------

"make doc" generates the C API reference documentation from the
NaturalDocs tags. The same documentation is available at:
    <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>


Tests
-----

Run either "make check" or "make test". Please note that in order to
enable tests, you must run `configure' with `--enable-tests'. Note also
that the test suite is intended for developers and *will* use the
Internet. See also $top_srcdir/tests/README.
