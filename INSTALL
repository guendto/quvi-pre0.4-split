* libcurl   7.18.0+  <http://curl.haxx.se/>

    Installation

./configure && make install

See also ./configure --help. For example:

    --enable-smut   enables adult website support
    --disable-quvi  disables building of the quvi program

"make dox" generates the C API reference documentation from
the doxygen tags. Both, HTML and LaTeX, documentation are
generated by default.

    Tests

"NO_INTERNET=1 ./make check" disables the tests that require
internet connection. TEST_RESTRICTED enables any tests that
have been disabled by default due to "country restrictions".

You can also set QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS if you need to pass any
additional options to quvi when the tests are run.
For example:
    QUVI_TEST_OPTIONS="--debug -n" ./make check
