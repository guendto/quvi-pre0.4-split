    C API documentation

"make dox" generates the C API reference documentation from the doxygen
tags. Both, HTML and LaTeX, documentation are generated by default. These
are also made available at: <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>


    Tests

Run either "make check" or "make test". Please note that in order to
enable tests, you must run `configure' with `--enable-tests'. Note also
that the test suite is intended for developers and *will* use the
Internet. See also $top_srcdir/tests/README.
