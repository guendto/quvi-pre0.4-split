Undeclared errors when upgrading

Example: upgrading to 0.2.8

% make
...
lib/quvi.c:225:10: error: 'QUVIOPT_NOSHORTENED' undeclared (first use in this function)
...

Cause: AM_ICONV sets CPPFLAGS which contains -I$dir that points to the location
of an old quvi.h from a previous installation without the enum. This -I$dir
is then prepended to the list of other -I when "make" is called, which causes
the compiler to pick the first quvi.h (from the old installation) and croak
with the above error.

Workarounds:
  * Uninstall the old version, or:
  * Edit manually the CPPFLAGS in
    Makefile
    lib/Makefile
    src/Makefile
    removing the -I$dir

If you've found an elegant fix to this, please let us know.
