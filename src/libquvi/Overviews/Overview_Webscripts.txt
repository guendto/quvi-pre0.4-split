Title: Overview: Webscripts

About: Parse URL

To parse an URL, libquvi runs "webscripts" (or "website scripts").
The parsed media details that are then returned to the application
using the quvi API. Each _supported_ website has a corresponding
script that was written specifically to handle that website. These
scripts are written in <LUA at http://www.lua.org/about.html>.

About: Technical differences

The webscripts are typically very different from one another. Writing
new ones and maintaining the existing ones are by far the most time
consuming part of the project. If you are interested in contributing new
scripts to the project, please see the existing scripts. They are the
best starting place.
