Debugging tips
--------------

When working with quvi lua scripts, you can set QUVI_BASEDIR
environment variable to point the location of the lua directory,
e.g. QUVI_BASEDIR=/home/user/debug

quvi searches for the scripts from the following paths in the
following order:

  1) $QUVI_BASEDIR defined path
  2) Current working directory (./lua/website/)
  3) $HOME./quvi/
  4) $HOME/.config/quvi/
  5) $HOME/.local/share/quvi/
  6) Global directories:
      /usr/local/share/quvi/ -- hardcoded
      /usr/share/quvi/ -- hardcoded
