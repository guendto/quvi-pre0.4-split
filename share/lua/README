This directory contains the quvi Lua scripts. If you are new to Lua,
<http://www.lua.org/pil/> is a good place to start.

  website/ subdir contains the website specific scripts (rules)


Debugging tips
--------------

Make a note of the search paths that quvi scans for the scripts.
The paths are search in the following order:

  1) $QUVI_BASEDIR defined path
  2) Current working directory (./lua/website/)
  3) $HOME./quvi/
  4) $HOME/.config/quvi/
  5) $HOME/.local/share/quvi/
  6) Global directories:
      /usr/local/share/quvi/ -- hardcoded
      /usr/share/quvi/ -- hardcoded

If you define QUVI_BASEDIR, make sure it points to a directory
containing lua/website/.
