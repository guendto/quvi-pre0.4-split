5. Getting started
------------------

The doxygen generated documentation covers the essentials.

You may also want to take a look at the examples/simple.c
and src/quvi.c files.

See INSTALL file for notes about generating the documentation.
The most recent documentation is also available via the project
website (http://quvi.googlecode.com/).

If you are interested in adding support for a new video website,
take a look at the share/lua/README and share/lua/website/README.
Example scripts can be found in share/lua/website/ directory.
