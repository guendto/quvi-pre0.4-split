    How you can help

* Report bugs (http://quvi.googlecode.com/)

* Write fixes

* Write support for additional websites
  - See the project source code to get the idea

* Gather and report website specific data
  - TCP traffic, etc. (there a number of tools to do this these days)
  - This data could be used to figure out how the videos can be extracted


    Notes

quvi is developed under Linux (x86) and occasionally tested under
FreeBSD (x86). It is impossible for us to detect and fix errors
on all different system configurations. Therefore any feedback and
help is greatly appreciated.

If you are a downstream maintainer, and you think the upstream and
others could benefit from your patches, please consider submitting
them to the upstream.
