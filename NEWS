Version 0.1.5
=============

Command line tool (quvi)

* --format,-f no longer accepts only hard-coded values

Library (libquvi)

Plenty of changes. Developers should read these changes carefully,
especially the "API changes".

Introduce Lua <http://lua.org> scripts. The fetching and parsing are
now done in scripts. This has a few advantages to the old design.

  * Dynamic script loading
    - Scripts can be dropped in (and removed from) the search path
    - See more about the search paths in quvi(1) and C API

  * No need to tweak C source code or recompile quvi
    - Faster and easier prototyping for new websites
      - Without having to dig into the C source code
    - Contributors unfamiliar with C
      - Lua is an easier language to understand
      - May now contribute by writing Lua scripts
      - There are plenty of examples (share/lua/ subdir) to learn from

These changes meant removing and converting the host specific code to lua
scripts. These scripts can be found in $top_srcdir/share/ directory.
They are installed typically to $prefix/share/quvi/lua/hosts/ directory.

Video format IDs were updated (see below). The previous releases
used incorrectly file suffices (e.g. "mp4") as format IDs, but
should not be treated as such if the website provides some more
sensible way to identify different available formats.

New project dependencies
------------------------
* Lua <http://lua.org/>

Video format changes
--------------------
This is an attempt to stadardize the formats array, and remove some
of the old (and usually missleading) format IDs.

* "Default" format was previously (for historical reasons) called "flv"
  - As of this release, "default" format stands for "default"
  - "flv" was missleading and incorrect (for some websites)
* Youtube
  - Cleanup: remove old vague IDs (e.g. "mp4")
  - May require further tweaking
* Google
  - Removed "mp4"
  - May be restored later (with appropriate format ID, "mp4" isn't such)

API changes
-----------
* Additional Lua related QUVIcodes
* quvi_next_host
  - Old: QUVIcode quvi_next_host (char **domain, char **formats)
    New: QUVIcode quvi_next_host (quvi_t, char **domain, char **formats)
  - Note that both "domain" and "formats" must now be freed after use
