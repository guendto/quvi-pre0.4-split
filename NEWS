Version 0.1.5
=============

* Developers should read these changes carefully, especially the "API changes"

* Introduce Lua <http://lua.org> scripts. The fetching and parsing are
now done in scripts. This has a few advantages to the old design.

  * Dynamic script loading
    - Scripts can be dropped in (and removed from) the search path
    - See more about the search paths in quvi(1) and C API

  * No need to tweak C source code or recompile quvi
    - Faster and easier prototyping for new websites
      - Without having to dig into the C source code
    - Contributors unfamiliar with C
      - Lua is an easier language to understand
      - May now contribute by writing Lua scripts
      - There are plenty of examples (share/lua/ subdir) to learn from

These changes meant removing and converting the host specific code to lua
scripts. These scripts can be found in $top_srcdir/share/ directory.
They are installed typically to $prefix/share/quvi/lua/hosts/ directory.

* There have been format ID changes, we're trying to weed out the
vague format IDs from the library, e.g. "mp4" could have multiple
meanings or double standards. More sensible IDs such as "hq" or
"hd" are encouraged to be used instead where/if possible, see below


Video format (ID) changes
-------------------------

Get on with the program, blatant objections will be directed to /dev/null.

* "Default" format was previously (for historical reasons) called only "flv"

  - "flv" refers to Adobe flash format but in reality some of the websites
  default to completely different formats

  - The "default format" is as of this release referred to as "default",
  see `quvi --hosts' to get the idea

* Youtube

  - Both cclive and clive have used vague IDs for different Youtube format IDs,
  a.k.a. "fmtID", we're trying to "standardize" these IDs by coming up with
  suitable (and more understandable) IDs for them, e.g. "hq_480p" or "hd_1080p"

  - Further ID tweaking may still be required as the intertubes is full of
  hear say and inaccurate information about these formats, having said that,
  one shouldn't hardcode these values in applications depending on libquvi,
  instead use the iteration function and parse the library returned format IDs

* Google

  - Removed the "mp4" format, does someone still actually use this website?

* Spiegel

  - Default to vp6_388, previously vp6_64


API changes
-----------
* New QUVIcodes (Lua related)

* quvi_next_host is now deprecated

  - quvi_next_host returns nothing and should no longer be used

  - Use quvi_next_supported_website instead, prototypes are similar

  - Conversion is simple, see API documentation or src/quvi.c for an example

  - Note that both "domain" and "formats" must now be freed


Version 0.1.2
-------------

Adds quvi_callback_write support, tweaks quvi_callback_status
support (abort if the callback returns a non-zero value).

Adds --enable-broken.

Tests now include use of "-f best" where applicable.

Minor (unlisted) tweaks and bugfixes to quvi tool.

Marks as broken: ehrensenf.de, spyfilms.com, see TODO.


Version 0.1.1
-------------

Fixes the issues that have been plaguing the users on 64bit
systems. See ChangeLog for the details.

Dailymotion format IDs were renamed to reflect the website
changes. See ChangeLog for the details.

Fixes also Vimeo support.
