Title: Submitting patches

About: Before you submit

Considerations.

 * You agree to put your changes and new code under the same license quvi
    and libquvi are using already unless stated and agreed otherwise

 * If you are submitting a new website script, please include a test JSON
    file with it
(start code)
    % quvi -q TEST_URL > foo.json
(end)

 * Please read also <Coding style>


About: Creating a patch

Please submit your contributions in the <patch at http://is.gd/lJdP1u>
format.

Create your patches with <git at http://git-scm.com/>:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

We prefer the git format as this allows us to preserve the contribution
details in the git log.

Otherwise:
    * If you do not know or use git, then please use "diff -u" if possible
    * If you are submitting a new webscript, you can submit it as it is

About: Where to submit

Please use our <Trac at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/quvi> to submit
your patches.
