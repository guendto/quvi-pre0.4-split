Howto: Submit patches
=====================

If you are using git:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

If you are working with diff, then at very least, use "diff -u" when you
generate the patch.

Visit the website at <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/> and click
"Development". You can submit your patches to the Trac that we use.

Alternatively, email them to the maintainer at <legatvs at sign gmail com>.

Thanks!
